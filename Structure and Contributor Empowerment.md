## 🪙 Empowerment Mechanisms

1. **Data Reputation Layer**  
   Each contributor receives an on-chain record of their uploads. These records form the foundation for reputation scores and SBT-based contributor credentials.

2. **Alliance Membership Visibility**  
   All alliance members are featured on the [Vault Registry Website](https://evermedia.xyz), where their verified contributions are highlighted — enhancing credibility and discoverability.

3. **Reusable Infrastructure**  
   Open APIs and schemas allow any project to plug into the Vault’s data model, making it easy to:
   - Build dashboards and feeds based on Vault data.  
   - Cross-reference metadata for research, analytics, and ecosystem reports.

4. **Ecosystem Incentives** *(future phase)*  
   - Integration with Filecoin grant programs (ProPGF / FOC service credits).  
   - Retroactive recognition for verified data contributions.  
   - NFT or SBT rewards for active contributors and alliance members.
